# Big O Notation: O(n)

## Overview

We’ll begin by looking at **O(n)** notation, which is not necessarily the most or least efficient, but it is the easiest to understand.

### Explanation Using a Function

Let's explore this notation with an example function called **logItems**.

#### Code Example:

- We have a function `logItems` that uses a **for loop** to log items.
- The loop runs **n** times, where **n** is the number passed into the function.
- During each iteration, we log the value of **i** (the loop index).

```javascript
function logItems(n) {
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        console.log(i);
    }
}
```

### Running the Example

- If we pass the function a value of **10**, it runs the loop **10** times.
- The output in the console will be the numbers **0** through **9**.

#### What O(n) Means

- **O(n)** means that the number of operations is **proportional** to the input **n**.
- In this example, when we pass **10** to the function, the loop runs **10** times and outputs **10** values.
- So, for every value of **n**, the function performs **n** operations.

### Visualizing O(n) on a Graph

- **O(n)** is represented by a **straight line**.
- The graph has:
  - The **x-axis** representing **n** (the input size).
  - The **y-axis** representing the **number of operations**.
- As **n** increases, the number of operations increases **linearly**.

### Key Takeaways

- **O(n)** is a linear time complexity.
- The number of operations grows directly in proportion to the input size **n**.
- This type of operation is simple to understand and commonly encountered.

### Conclusion

- We’ve just looked at **O(n)**, where the number of operations increases linearly with the input size.
- In the next lessons, we will compare this notation to others, such as **O(1)** and **O(n^2)**, using graphs to help visualize and compare the differences.

This markdown will help you revise the concept of **O(n)** time complexity, explaining how the number of operations grows proportionally to the input size.
