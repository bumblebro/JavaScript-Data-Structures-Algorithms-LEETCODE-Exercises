When we look under the hood of a linked list, we need to understand what each **node** is made of and how they interact with each other. Let's break down how this works:

### Structure of a Node:
- A **node** in a linked list consists of two parts:
  1. **Value**: The data stored in that node.
  2. **Next**: A pointer that refers to the next node in the list (or `null` if it's the last node).
  
  So, each node is an **object** that looks something like this in JavaScript:
  ```js
  {
    value: 7,
    next: { value: 4, next: { value: 23, next: null } }
  }
  ```

### Building the Linked List:
1. **Creating the first node (7)**:
   - We create a node with a value of `7`. This node will be the head of the linked list.
   - At this point, the `next` property of this node will be `null` because there is no other node yet.

2. **Adding the second node (4)**:
   - We create a second node with a value of `4`.
   - The first node (7) now needs to point to this new node.
   - This is done by setting the `next` property of the first node (7) to the second node (4).
   - Now the first node looks like this:
     ```js
     {
       value: 7,
       next: { value: 4, next: null }
     }
     ```

3. **Adding more nodes (23, 3, 11)**:
   - We continue to add nodes by linking them through their `next` properties.
   - For example, the `next` property of the 4 node will point to the 23 node, the 23 node will point to the 3 node, and so on.
   - After adding these nodes, the linked list looks like this:
     ```js
     {
       value: 7,
       next: {
         value: 4,
         next: {
           value: 23,
           next: {
             value: 3,
             next: {
               value: 11,
               next: null
             }
           }
         }
       }
     }
     ```

4. **Head and Tail**:
   - **Head**: The `head` pointer always points to the first node (7 in this case).
   - **Tail**: The `tail` pointer points to the last node (11 in this case), and its `next` property is `null`.

### How it Works:
- The **head** pointer is always used to access the first node, and from there, each node points to the next one until you reach the end of the list (`null`).
- By setting the `next` property of each node to point to the next node, we create the linked structure.

### Visualization:
- **Graphical Representation**: This is simplified for readability, but underneath the graphic, this is how nodes are actually represented:
  ```
  head → {7} → {4} → {23} → {3} → {11} → null
  ```

- **Under the Hood**: Each node is essentially a small object with two properties (`value` and `next`), and these objects are linked together by the `next` pointer.

### Conclusion:
When we add a new node to a linked list, we are essentially manipulating the `next` pointer of the previous node to point to the new node. This is how linked lists form a chain of objects, where each node knows where the next node is, making it a dynamic and flexible data structure.
