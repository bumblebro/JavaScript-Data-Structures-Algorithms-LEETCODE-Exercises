Let's break down how we build the constructor for a linked list and how it works in JavaScript.

### Step 1: **Create the Node Class**

We begin by building a **Node** class because each item in the linked list is a node. This node holds two things:
- **Value**: The actual data stored in the node.
- **Next**: A pointer (or reference) to the next node in the list.

The constructor for the node looks like this:

```js
class Node {
  constructor(value) {
    this.value = value;
    this.next = null; // Initially, no next node, so it's null
  }
}
```

So, when we create a new node, we will use:

```js
const newNode = new Node(4); // Creates a node with a value of 4
```

### Step 2: **Create the Linked List Class**

Next, we create the **LinkedList** class. The constructor of the `LinkedList` is responsible for creating the linked list with one node, which is passed as a value during the instantiation.

Here's how we structure the constructor for the linked list:

```js
class LinkedList {
  constructor(value) {
    const newNode = new Node(value); // Create a new node
    this.head = newNode; // Head points to the new node
    this.tail = newNode; // Tail points to the same new node (since it's the only node)
    this.length = 1; // Length is 1 because we just added one node
  }
}
```

### Step 3: **Creating the Linked List**

When you instantiate a new `LinkedList` by passing a value, it will create a linked list with one node. The `head` and `tail` will point to this node, and the `length` will be `1`.

For example:

```js
const myList = new LinkedList(4);
```

- This will create a linked list with one node where both the `head` and `tail` point to the node containing `4`.
- The `length` will be `1` because there is only one node in the list.

### Step 4: **Testing the Code in DevTools**

Let's test this constructor in the browser console (DevTools):

```js
class Node {
  constructor(value) {
    this.value = value;
    this.next = null;
  }
}

class LinkedList {
  constructor(value) {
    const newNode = new Node(value);
    this.head = newNode;
    this.tail = newNode;
    this.length = 1;
  }
}

const myList = new LinkedList(4);
console.log(myList); // This will show the linked list with head, tail, and length
```

After running this, if you inspect `myList`:

- **head** and **tail** will point to the same node with a value of `4` and `next: null`.
- **length** will be `1`, indicating that the linked list contains one node.

### Step 5: **Structure of the Linked List in Memory**

Under the hood:
- `head` and `tail` both point to the same node object. This node has a value of `4` and `next` set to `null`.
- The length of the list is 1 because we only have one node.

### Final Code Summary:

```js
class Node {
  constructor(value) {
    this.value = value;
    this.next = null; // Initially points to null
  }
}

class LinkedList {
  constructor(value) {
    const newNode = new Node(value); // Create a new node
    this.head = newNode; // Head points to this node
    this.tail = newNode; // Tail points to the same node
    this.length = 1; // Length is 1 because we just created one node
  }
}

const myList = new LinkedList(4);
console.log(myList); // Logs the linked list with head, tail, and length
```

This gives us a basic working linked list with a single node. From here, we can expand by adding methods like `push`, `unshift`, and `insert` to manipulate the linked list further.
