Here's a summary of the **class** concepts explained, formatted in markdown:

# Introduction to Classes

Classes are like "cookie cutters" in programming. They allow us to create objects (like cookies) that share common properties and methods. Let’s break down how classes work with a practical analogy.

## The Cookie Class Example

### Defining a Class
We begin by defining a class. In this case, the class is called `Cookie`.

```javascript
class Cookie {
  constructor(color) {
    this.color = color;  // 'this' refers to the current cookie object being created.
  }
}
```

- **Class Name**: The class name is always capitalized (e.g., `Cookie`).
- **Constructor**: The constructor method is used to create new instances of the class. In this case, we pass a `color` parameter to set the color of the cookie.

### Creating Instances (Objects)
To create a new cookie, we use the `new` keyword and pass the color.

```javascript
let cookie1 = new Cookie("green");  // Green cookie
let cookie2 = new Cookie("blue");   // Blue cookie
```

- **cookie1** and **cookie2** are instances of the `Cookie` class.
- **this** inside the constructor refers to the specific instance being created (e.g., `cookie1` or `cookie2`).

### Adding Methods: Getters and Setters

To access and modify the cookie’s color, we use methods such as **getColor** and **setColor**.

```javascript
class Cookie {
  constructor(color) {
    this.color = color;
  }

  // Getter method for color
  getColor() {
    return this.color;
  }

  // Setter method for color
  setColor(newColor) {
    this.color = newColor;
  }
}
```

### Using Getters and Setters

Here’s how you would interact with the methods:

```javascript
console.log(cookie1.getColor());  // Outputs: green
cookie1.setColor("yellow");
console.log(cookie1.getColor());  // Outputs: yellow
```

### Building Data Structures Using Classes

Classes are essential when building complex data structures like linked lists.

#### Linked List Example

A `LinkedList` class may have a constructor to create the first node, and methods to add, remove, or access nodes in the list.

```javascript
class LinkedList {
  constructor(value) {
    this.head = { value: value, next: null };
  }

  push(value) {
    // Add a new node to the list
  }

  unshift(value) {
    // Add a node to the beginning of the list
  }

  // Other methods: insert, remove, pop, shift, etc.
}
```

### Using the LinkedList Class

Once the `LinkedList` class is built, we can create a new linked list and perform operations like adding or removing nodes.

```javascript
let myLinkedList = new LinkedList(23);
myLinkedList.push(7);
myLinkedList.unshift(3);
myLinkedList.insert(1, 11);
myLinkedList.remove(1);
myLinkedList.pop();
myLinkedList.shift();
```

### Summary

- **Classes** provide a blueprint for creating objects with shared properties and methods.
- **Constructors** are used to initialize objects.
- **Methods** like getters and setters are used to interact with objects.
- **Data structures** like linked lists are built using classes, allowing for efficient operations on the data.

Classes are a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming, and understanding them helps you build complex systems and data structures.
```

This summary covers the essentials of working with classes, starting from simple examples (like a `Cookie` class) and expanding to more complex use cases, such as building a `LinkedList` class.
