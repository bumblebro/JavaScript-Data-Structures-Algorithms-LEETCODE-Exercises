# Big O Notation: O(1) (Constant Time)

## Overview

The next Big O notation we will explore is **O(1)**, also known as **constant time**.

### Explanation of O(1)

Let's start with some simple code:

#### Code Example: Add Items

```javascript
function addItems(n) {
    return n + n;
}
```

- In this function, we have only **one operation**: the addition of **n + n**.
- The number of operations is **1**, regardless of the size of **n**.
  - It doesn't matter if **n** is **1** or a **million**; the operation count remains constant.

### Simplification

- If we add another addition operation, the code will look like this:

```javascript
function addItems(n) {
    return n + n + n;
}
```

- This introduces **two operations**, but **O(2)** simplifies to **O(1)**, because the number of operations doesn't change with the size of **n**.
- This is still **constant time**, since the number of operations remains fixed.

### Key Concept

- **O(1)** refers to constant time, meaning the time complexity does not depend on the size of the input, **n**.
- Whether **n** is small or large, the number of operations will always remain constant.

### Graph Representation

On a graph, **O(1)** is represented as a **flat line**, indicating no change in the number of operations as **n** increases.

### Conclusion

- **O(1)** is the most efficient Big O notation because it involves the fewest operations.
- It is commonly referred to as **constant time**.
- When you hear the term **constant time**, it's the same as **O(1)**.
```

These notes explain **O(1)** as constant time, where the number of operations does not change with the size of the input. This is the most efficient Big O notation.
