# Big O Notation: Dropping Non-Dominant Terms

## Overview

Another way to simplify Big O notation is by **dropping non-dominant terms**. This helps focus on the most significant factor affecting the algorithm’s growth rate.

### Explanation of Non-Dominant Terms

To explain this, we will build on the nested loop example from the previous video, where we had a nested **for loop**. This time, we will add a **third for loop** after the nested loops.

#### Code Example:

```javascript
function logItems(n) {
    // First nested for loop (O(n²))
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            console.log(i, j);
        }
    }
    
    // Second for loop (O(n))
    for (let k = 0; k < n; k++) {
        console.log(k);
    }
}
```

#### Running the Code

- If we call this function with **n = 10**, the output will be:
  - The **nested for loop** will output **100 items** (as it runs **O(n²)** times).
  - The **second loop** will output **10 items** (as it runs **O(n)** times).

### Analyzing the Complexity

- The total time complexity is **O(n² + n)**.
- If we think about the numbers, if **n = 100**, **n²** would be **10,000**, and the additional **n** would only be **100**.
- The **n²** term (which represents the nested loops) dominates the total operations, and the **n** term has minimal impact on the overall complexity.

### Dropping Non-Dominant Terms

- Since **n²** is the dominant term, the **n** term is **non-dominant**.
- In Big O notation, we drop the non-dominant term, simplifying the complexity to just **O(n²)**.

### Conclusion

- **Dropping non-dominant terms** helps simplify Big O notation by focusing on the term that grows fastest as the input size increases.
- In this case, **O(n² + n)** simplifies to **O(n²)**.

This markdown helps explain **dropping non-dominant terms** in Big O notation, showing how terms that grow slower (like **O(n)**) are omitted when they don't significantly affect the algorithm's overall growth rate.
