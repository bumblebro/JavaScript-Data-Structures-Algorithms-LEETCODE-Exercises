# Big O Notation: Different Terms for Inputs

## Overview

In technical interviews, a common "gotcha" question involves **using different terms for inputs** in Big O notation. This concept often trips people up when they try to apply single-variable notations like **O(n)** without considering multiple input variables.

### Problem Setup

To explain this, let's revisit the example of nested loops. Previously, we saw a pair of loops that each ran **n times**, resulting in **O(n)**. When combined, the complexity was simplified to **O(2n)**, which we dropped the constant and simplified to **O(n)**.

### The Gotcha: Multiple Input Variables

Now, let's say we have **two variables** instead of just one. For example, we have two loops:
- The first loop runs **A times**.
- The second loop runs **B times**.

#### Common Mistake

A knee-jerk reaction might be to say:
- The first loop is **O(A)**.
- The second loop is **O(B)**.
- Adding them together, we might mistakenly simplify this to **O(A + B)**, or even further to **O(n)** by assuming **A = n** and **B = n**.

This is **incorrect** because **A** and **B** are independent variables. **A** may not always be equal to **n**, and **B** may not either. For example:
- If **A = 1** and **B = 1,000,000**, the complexity should reflect these values.

### Correct Approach

- **If the loops are not nested**, the total complexity is **O(A + B)**.
  - This means we must keep track of both variables separately and cannot combine them into a single **n**.
  
- **If the loops are nested**, the complexity becomes **O(A * B)**.
  - For example, if the first loop runs **A times** and the second loop runs **B times** for each iteration of the first loop, the total operations become the product of both.

### Conclusion

- **You cannot assume that A = n and B = n** unless explicitly stated in the problem.
- When there are multiple input variables, keep the terms distinct:
  - **O(A + B)** for independent loops.
  - **O(A * B)** for nested loops.
```

These notes explain the common misconception when dealing with multiple input variables in Big O notation, highlighting the importance of distinguishing the variables and not assuming they are the same (like **n**).
