# Simplifying Big O Notation: Dropping Constants

## Overview

Big O notation can be simplified in various ways to make it easier to understand and compare algorithms. One of the main simplifications is called **dropping constants**.

### Understanding Dropping Constants

Let’s look at an example to explain this simplification.

#### Code Example with Two Loops

We will start with the **O(n)** code from the previous video, but now we’ll add a second identical **for loop** that also runs **n** times, except it will use **j** instead of **i**.

```javascript
function logItems(n) {
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        console.log(i);
    }
    
    for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        console.log(j);
    }
}
```

#### Running the Code

- If we call this function with **n = 3**, the output will be:
  - **0, 1, 2** from the first loop.
  - **0, 1, 2** from the second loop.
  
- The code runs **2n** operations in total, as each loop runs **n** times.

#### What This Means for Big O

- Technically, this would be an **O(2n)** operation, since there are two loops that each run **n** times.
- However, **Big O** simplifies this by dropping constants.

### The Rule: Drop Constants

- It doesn’t matter if the constant is **2n**, **3n**, or even **100n**—we drop the constant.
- In this case, we simplify **O(2n)** to **O(n)**.

### Conclusion

- **Dropping constants** is the first rule for simplifying Big O notation.
- This simplification makes it easier to compare the efficiency of algorithms by focusing on the input size rather than constant factors that don’t significantly affect the algorithm’s growth rate.
```

This markdown will help you understand the simplification rule of **dropping constants** in Big O notation, which makes it easier to focus on the growth rate of an algorithm without worrying about constant factors.
