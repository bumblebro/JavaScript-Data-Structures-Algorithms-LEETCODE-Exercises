# Big O Notation and Its Importance

## Overview

Big O notation is a critical concept in technical interviews. It helps determine the efficiency of algorithms and makes you a better coder. Understanding Big O is crucial for:
- Technical interviews
- Writing efficient code

## Concept Introduction

### Comparing Two Pieces of Code

- **Code 1 vs. Code 2**: 
    - Both accomplish the same task, but the implementation differs.
    - How do we determine which one is more efficient?

### Measuring Efficiency: Time vs. Operations

- **Time Complexity**: 
    - We cannot measure the efficiency of code by time alone.
    - Running code on faster hardware will make it finish faster, but the number of operations will remain constant.
    - Therefore, time complexity is measured by **operations** rather than **time**.

#### Time Complexity Example:
- Run **Code 1**: Takes 15 seconds.
- Run **Code 2**: Takes longer than 15 seconds.
- **Code 1** is more efficient in terms of time complexity because it completes quicker.
  
#### Why Operations Matter:
- Even if the execution time changes due to hardware, the number of operations remains consistent, making it a better metric for performance.

### Space Complexity

- **Space Complexity**: Measures the amount of memory used by the code.
- Example:
    - **Code 1**: Runs fast but uses a lot of memory.
    - **Code 2**: Takes longer to run but uses less memory.
- If memory usage is a priority, **Code 2** might be better, even though it runs slower.

## Key Focus Areas for Interviews

1. **Time Complexity**: 
    - Most important for this course and interviews.
    - Focus on how fast your code runs with respect to the number of operations.
  
2. **Space Complexity**: 
    - Will also be addressed in interviews, especially if you optimize for time complexity.
    - Interviewers might ask how you would handle a scenario where space is more important than time.

## Conclusion

- Understanding both **Time Complexity** and **Space Complexity** is essential.
- The primary focus for this course will be on **Time Complexity**.
- Be prepared for questions about both aspects during interviews.
