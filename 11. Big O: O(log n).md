# Big O Notation: O(log n) (Logarithmic Time)

## Overview

The final Big O notation we will explore is **O(log n)**, also known as **logarithmic time**.

### Explanation of O(log n)

To explain **O(log n)**, we will use an example of a **sorted array**.

#### Code Example: Binary Search

Let's assume we have a sorted array, and we want to find a particular number in the array. The most efficient way to do this is through **binary search**, which uses the **divide and conquer** technique.

- **Step 1:** We start by cutting the array in half and check if the number is in the first or second half.
- **Step 2:** Once we know which half the number is in, we cut that half in half again and repeat the process.
- **Step 3:** This continues until we find the number.

#### Key Insight

- If we have an array with **8 items**, it takes **3 steps** to find the number (cutting the array in half each time).
  - **2^3 = 8**, which gives us the number of steps needed.

- In general, the number of steps to find a number in a sorted array is proportional to **log₂(n)**, where **n** is the number of elements in the array.

#### Logarithmic Example

For a large array of over a billion items:
- **log₂(1,000,000,000) ≈ 31**
- It would take **31 steps** to find any number in that array using binary search, rather than iterating through all items.

### Graph Representation

- **O(log n)** is much more efficient than **O(n)** or **O(n²)**, especially for large values of **n**.
- The graph of **O(log n)** is **very flat**, indicating fewer operations even as **n** grows large.

### Comparison with Other Notations

- **O(log n)** is much more efficient than **O(n)** (linear time) and **O(n²)** (quadratic time), making it ideal for operations on large datasets.

### O(n log n)

- **O(n log n)** is used in some sorting algorithms. It is the most efficient sorting algorithm for multiple types of data, such as strings.
- We will discuss **O(n log n)** in more detail when we explore sorting algorithms.

### Conclusion

- **O(log n)** is an efficient time complexity and is used in algorithms like **binary search**.
- This is one of the most efficient time complexities for searching in sorted data, especially for large datasets.

These notes explain **O(log n)**, which represents **logarithmic time**. This notation is used for algorithms that reduce the problem size in each step, such as binary search, and is much more efficient for large inputs than linear or quadratic time complexities.
