# Big O Notation: O(n²)

## Overview

Next, we will look at **O(n²)**, which represents quadratic time complexity. This occurs when the number of operations grows at a rate proportional to the square of the input size.

### Explanation with Nested Loops

We’ll start by modifying the code from the previous video, where we had a **for loop** followed by another **for loop**. This time, we'll **nest one for loop inside the other** and remove the **console logs**. Instead, we’ll log the values of **i** and **j** inside the two loops.

#### Code Example:

```javascript
function logItems(n) {
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            console.log(i, j);
        }
    }
}
```

#### Running the Code

- If we call this function with **n = 10**, the output will be:
  - We start with **0, 0** and go all the way to **9, 9**.
  - In total, we output **100 items** (since there are 10 iterations of the outer loop and 10 iterations of the inner loop).

### Understanding O(n²)

- The number of operations in this case is **n * n**, or **n²**.
- This is why we refer to this as **O(n²)**, meaning that the time complexity grows quadratically with the input size.

### Comparing O(n) and O(n²) on a Graph

- **O(n²)** is represented as a **quadratic growth curve**, and **O(n)** is represented as a **linear growth curve**.
- If we compare two pieces of code, one with **O(n²)** and the other with **O(n)**, the **O(n)** code will complete the task in fewer operations, making it more efficient.

### Why O(n²) is Less Efficient

- **O(n²)** is considered less efficient than **O(n)** because it involves nested loops, and as the input size grows, the number of operations increases at a much faster rate.
- Writing efficient code that avoids quadratic time complexity can lead to significant performance improvements.

### Conclusion

- **O(n²)** represents quadratic time complexity, which occurs when there are nested loops.
- It’s generally better to aim for **O(n)** time complexity, as it will scale more efficiently with larger input sizes.

This markdown helps you understand **O(n²)** time complexity, demonstrating how nested loops lead to quadratic growth in the number of operations. It also compares **O(n)** and **O(n²)** in terms of efficiency.
