# Linked Lists vs Arrays

Linked lists are one of the most important data structures and are often compared to arrays. Here's how they differ:

## 1. **Indexes**:
   - **Arrays** have **indexes** that help you access any element by its position in the array.
   - **Linked Lists** do not have indexes. Instead, each item (node) contains a reference to the next item in the list.

## 2. **Memory Allocation**:
   - **Arrays** store their elements in **contiguous memory locations**. This means the elements are stored one after another in the computer's memory.
   - **Linked Lists** do not require contiguous memory. Each node in a linked list can be stored in any location in memory, and each node has a reference (or pointer) to the next node in the list.

## 3. **Structure Representation**:
   - Instead of using indexes, linked lists use **pointers**. Each node has:
     - A value (the data for that node)
     - A **pointer** to the next node
   - The last node points to `null`, indicating the end of the list. This is known as a **null-terminated list**.

## 4. **Visual Representation**:
   - **Arrays**: Items are arranged in a straight line, one after another.
   - **Linked Lists**: Items are represented as nodes (often depicted as circles or boxes) where each node points to the next node. Here's a visual breakdown:
     - `head` points to the first item in the list.
     - `tail` points to the last item in the list.
     - Each node points to the next node in the sequence, and the last node points to `null`.

## 5. **Memory Location**:
   - **Arrays** are stored in one contiguous block in memory.
   - **Linked Lists**' nodes can be scattered across memory, as each node has its own memory location and contains a reference to the next node.

## Example:
```plaintext
Array:
[ 1, 2, 3, 4 ]

Linked List:
Head → 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → null
```

### Key Differences:
- **Arrays** are better when you need fast access to elements by index.
- **Linked Lists** are more flexible in memory usage and are useful when you need efficient insertion and deletion operations.

This summary contrasts arrays and linked lists by showing their differences in memory allocation, structure, and indexing. It provides a foundation for understanding how linked lists work and how they differ from arrays.
